# Car_Frames
I used VLC to watch the video and extract frames, as it was convenient for my project involving many cars. I paused the video when I saw a car with a clear plate number and used the frame-by-frame feature of VLC to take snapshots until I had ten frames for each car.

However, I faced challenges with some plates. While certain plates were clear, others had letters that were only partially visible, leading to confusion. Unfortunately, the only solution for this issue is to increase the resolution, which isn't always possible.

In summary, I didn't have enough time to automate car detection, but the experience was valuable. It emphasized the importance of having a good view of the license plates for accurate recognition
